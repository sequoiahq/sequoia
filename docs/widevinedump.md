Recently, Telly (**we explained who was above**), disguising as "Widevinedump" on Github, released a series of tools claiming to allow users to download content from popular streaming platforms like Disney+, Amazon, and Netflix. While these tools appeared legitimate and functional, there is indeed story behind that. As said before, this user was a scammer disguised, so from now on, **we're gonna call him Telly, not Widevinedump**.

### The Tools 

Telly releases various tools for different streaming services, as shown in the image below.

We can see that he was providing tools for AMZN (Prime Video), DSNP (Disney Plus), NF (Netflix) and GPLAY (Google Play Movies), between others. He also included an **Lenovo L1 CDM** (**we talked above about what was a CDM and its levels**), which appeared to be **blocked in AMZN and DSNP**, but working in NF and other sites that required an L1 CDM.

Obviously, the L1 CDM was quickly burned (check above for the definition).

The tools themselves were outdated but working. As we talked earlier, Telly ~~was~~ **is** a scammer, so it's almost sure that these tools weren't developed by him but stole from another individual/s. 

Also, the tools didn't include a CDM (although one L1 key was leaked also, but, as said, was quickly burned) and required the end users to buy from the author contacting him via e-mail.

### What was his motivation?
You may wonder **why** he could have leaked that. He publicly stated that part of his reasoning for leaking these tools was to *punish* certain individuals on Discord. I've seen Telly talking before on Discord and, although I'm not sure, it's probable that he tried to resell some product from another seller or something of that style, so that could explain how he got the tools.

### DMCA

The repo was later struck by MPA trough a DMCA compliant ([which you can see here](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/71710637c103ec842e6f0fec947482cad479e300/2022/01/2022-01-07-mpa.md)).

Hundreds of forks appeared, so the MPA **also struck that forks**. You can clearly check it [here](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/71710637c103ec842e6f0fec947482cad479e300/2022/01/2022-01-07-mpa.md).

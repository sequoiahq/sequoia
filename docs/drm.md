### Introduction
PlayReady is the DRM developed by Microsoft, while Widevine is associated with Google, and Fairplay is Apple's solution. These DRMs are primarily used by major streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, and others. Each system features different security levels, which often restrict the maximum resolution available for playback on various devices.
